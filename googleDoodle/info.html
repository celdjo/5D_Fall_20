            <div id="leftColumn">Black History Month is an annual celebration of achievements by African Americans and a
                time for recognizing the central role of blacks in U.S. history. Also known as African American History
                Month, the event grew out of “Negro History Week,” the brainchild of noted historian Carter G. Woodson
                and other prominent African Americans. Since 1976, every U.S. president has officially designated the
                month of February as Black History Month. Other countries around the world, including Canada and the
                United Kingdom, also devote a month to celebrating black history.

                Since 1976, every American president has designated February as Black History Month and endorsed a
                specific theme.

                The Black History Month 2020 theme, “African Americans and the Vote,” is in honor of the centennial
                anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) granting women’s suffrage and the sesquicentennial of the
                Fifteenth Amendment (1870) giving black men the right to vote.
